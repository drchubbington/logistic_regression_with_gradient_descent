# logistic_regression_with_gradient_descent
A simple implementation of the stochastic gradient descent algorithm to classify inputs into two categories.
Gradient descent is a way to find local minima in a curve. This can be applied to logistic regression to minimize the logarithmic error function.
The error function is reflected horizontally based on the category (0 or 1), so combining both functions forms a curve with a local minimum.
